<p align="left">How it all happened? In 1979 we applied for visa to get out of 
USSR and got a refusal. Mother, Inna Kitrossky-Meiman married Naum Meiman of 
blessed memory, known mathematician. Then she was diagnosed with cancer. Naum 
decided to demand visa for her to get treatment in US. The fight continued until 
1987, till then mother underwent several surgeries on the back of her neck. She 
finally got permission to leave and went to US in January 1987. We all left 
behind. Very soon, in February 1987, mother's life came to sudden finish. It 
happened in Georgetown, DC. So, she was buried on Jewish cemetery in Washington. 
Naum and I both wanted to go to funerals, and I unexpectedly got permission at 
the very last moment. Concord plane allowed me to arrive the same moment when 
funerals left to cemetery. My picture was in some US newspapers, see older 
memorial page. After two weeks in US I returned to Moscow to Marina and three 
kids, but soon we were let to go permanently to Israel. Naum arrived to Israel 
later and died there. <br>
On pictures above the cemetery, Inna's sister and my aunt Olga 
in black, Marina in green.</p>
